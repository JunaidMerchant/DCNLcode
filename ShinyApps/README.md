# ShinyApps

These are a collection of web apps I created using ShinyR to help RAs score clinical measures and to perform 3-way classification based on behavioral profiles of executive dysfunction.

### ADHD-RS 
This app scores the ADHD rating scale version 5, and is specific to how it was collected in our Qualtrics surveys. You can find the live version here: https://dcnl-georgetownu.shinyapps.io/ADHD-RS/

### RDoC-SVM 
This app was created with Xiaozhen You. It classifies 8-14 y/o children into 1 of 3 class/profiles of executive dysfunction based on their scores on the ADHD-RS, CBCL, and BRIEF. These profiles were derived from community detection clustering algorithms that were applied to a sample of 300 children presenting with some sort of psychiatric symptoms (and replicated in a separate sample), indicating executive dysfunctions that cut across diagnoses. 

More information and publication on this approach here: Vaidya, C. J., You, X., Mostofsky, S., Pereira, F., Berl, M. M., & Kenworthy, L. (2020). Data‚Äêdriven identification of subtypes of executive function across typical development, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 61(1), 51-61.

### SRS-2
This app scores the SRS scale, and is specific to how it was collected in our Qualtrics surveys. You can find the live version here: https://dcnl-georgetownu.shinyapps.io/SRS-2/

### STAI
This app scores the STAI scale, and is specific to how it was collected in our Qualtrics surveys. You can find the live version here: https://dcnl-georgetownu.shinyapps.io/STAI/
